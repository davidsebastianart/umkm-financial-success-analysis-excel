   - However, the **"Moderate"** category performs best at **53.60%** success rate.

   - UMKM with "High" Marketing Effort Category achieve the highest success rate at **42.40%**, compared to **28.40%** (Medium) and **29.20%** (Low).  
   - Internet usage provides an additional boost, especially noticeable in the "Low" marketing category (success rate higher with Internet "Yes").  
   - **Recommendation**: Promote affordable digital marketing training and internet access programs, particularly for low-marketing UMKM.

3. **Encourage Professional Consultation**  
   - Higher Professional Advice frequency (scores 5–7) shows fluctuating but generally positive correlation with success rate (around 10–20%) and financial score.  
   - **Recommendation**: Facilitate regular access to mentors, consultants, or business incubators to increase consultation frequency.
